## How to use this thing
Download the repo. make sure bot.py and excuses.txt are in the same directory.
You need python installed.

Run the python script in your terminal with: 
 - python3 bot.py (Mac/Linux)
 - python bot.py (Windows)

There will be a chat thing. ask it anything!
If some wacky excuse pops up, It works!

If the message: "Uh oh. Couldn't find my excuse manual." comes up,
bot.py and excuses.txt are NOT in the same directory.

To quit, type one of these:
quit, exit, bye, i hate you bye

Have fun, there are some hilarious combos with this i swear!
